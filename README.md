# The Relationship Between Chinese Gold Jewelry Company Stock Prices and Gold Futures: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis

## Executive Summary

This research examines the relationship between Chinese gold jewelry company stock prices and gold futures prices using data from 2010-2025 across multiple time frequencies. A market-cap-weighted Gold Jewelry Index was constructed from three major Hong Kong-listed companies. Analysis reveals a consistently positive and statistically significant relationship that strengthens dramatically across time horizons: daily (R² = 0.003, β = 0.05), monthly (R² = 0.115, β = 0.35), quarterly (R² = 0.131, β = 0.38), and yearly (R² = 0.290, β = 0.54). After controlling for broader market movements via the Hang Seng Index in multiple regression models, gold price movements retain independent predictive power (p < 0.05) for jewelry stock returns at monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies, validating the fundamental economic linkage between raw material costs/demand dynamics and corporate valuations. Formal F-tests comparing linear and non-linear models reveal that polynomial specifications with squared terms and interaction effects provide statistically significant improvements only for daily and monthly frequencies, while simpler linear specifications are optimal at quarterly and yearly horizons.

## 1. Research Methodology

### 1.1 Data Collection and Filtering

**Gold Price Data:**
- COMEX Gold Futures (GC=F) - selected as primary gold price proxy
- Gold ETF GLD and IAU - excluded due to near-perfect correlation with COMEX Futures (ρ ≈ 0.99-1.00), avoiding multicollinearity in regression models
- Silver Futures (SI=F) - excluded as non-core to gold jewelry analysis

**Chinese Jewelry Company Stocks:**

*Included Companies:*
- Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group (1929.HK) - Largest player, substantial fixed-price gold jewelry by weight
- Luk Fook Holdings (0590.HK) - Major competitor, similar business model
- Chow Sang Sang Holdings (0116.HK) - Established brand, significant fixed-price exposure

*Excluded Companies and Rationale:*
- China National Gold (600916.SS) - Limited data history (post-2015), significantly shortens analysis period
- Laopu Gold (6181.HK) - Different business model emphasizing high-craftsmanship artisanal pieces where gold price by weight is less dominant in final pricing compared to design/craftsmanship premiums

**Market Index:**
- Hang Seng Index (^HSI) - Control variable for Hong Kong market movements

**Data Period:** January 2010 - October 2025 (constrained by Chow Tai Fook IPO date in December 2011; actual analysis begins when all three companies have complete data)

### 1.2 Gold Jewelry Index Construction

A market capitalization-weighted index ("Gold Jewelry Index China") was constructed following established index methodology:

**Formula:** 
Index_t = 100 × (Σ(Market Cap_i,t) / Σ(Market Cap_i,0))

Where i represents each constituent company, t is current time, and 0 is the base period.

**Rationale for Market-Cap Weighting:**
1. Reflects true economic significance - larger companies have proportionally larger impact
2. Mirrors widely-recognized indices (S&P 500, MSCI indices) 
3. Self-rebalancing as market capitalizations naturally adjust
4. Reduces noise from company-specific events
5. Provides sector-level benchmark for investment analysis

**Base Value:** Normalized to 100 at earliest date with complete data for all three constituents

**Selection Criteria:**
Companies were selected based on:
1. Significant exposure to fixed-price gold jewelry (pricing directly linked to gold weight × prevailing gold price + markup)
2. Consistent trading history from 2010-2011 onwards
3. Hong Kong listing for market consistency
4. Complete, reliable data availability

This filtering ensures the analysis focuses on companies whose stock performance is most directly linked to gold price fluctuations through their business models.

## 2. Descriptive Statistics and Distribution Analysis

### 2.1 Daily Return Characteristics

**Mean Daily Returns:**
- COMEX Gold Futures: 0.035%
- Gold ETF GLD: 0.044%
- Gold ETF IAU: 0.037%
- Silver Futures: 0.038%
- Chow Tai Fook: 0.078%
- Luk Fook Holdings: 0.063%
- Chow Sang Sang: 0.050%
- Laopu Gold: 0.850% (limited data period)
- China National Gold: 0.057%
- Hang Seng Index: 0.014%

**Standard Deviation (Volatility):**
- COMEX Gold Futures: 0.98%
- Gold ETF GLD: 1.01%
- Gold ETF IAU: 0.98%
- Silver Futures: 1.92% (notably higher)
- Chow Tai Fook: 2.21%
- Luk Fook Holdings: 2.48%
- Chow Sang Sang: 2.50%
- Laopu Gold: 4.83% (limited data)
- China National Gold: 2.44%
- Hang Seng Index: 1.32%

**Key Finding:** Jewelry stocks exhibit 2-2.5× higher volatility than gold assets and 1.7-1.9× higher than Hang Seng Index, indicating elevated risk but potentially higher return opportunities.

**Extreme Movements (Min/Max Daily Returns):**
- Silver Futures: -17.75% to +9.29% (widest range)
- Chow Sang Sang: -12.88% to +27.51%
- Chow Tai Fook: -18.50% to +11.34%
- COMEX Gold Futures: -9.29% to +5.97%
- Hang Seng Index: -8.65% to +5.87%

### 2.2 Distribution Properties: Jarque-Bera Test Results

**Daily Returns:**
All assets reject normality (p-value = 0.0000 for all assets with sufficient data)

**Skewness:**
- Gold assets (COMEX, GLD, IAU): Negative skewness (-0.21 to -0.30), indicating more frequent small losses or fewer large gains
- Jewelry stocks: Positive skewness (+0.09 to +1.21), suggesting more frequent small gains or fewer large losses
- Hang Seng Index: Negative skewness (-0.35)

**Kurtosis (Excess Kurtosis):**
All assets show significant leptokurtosis:
- COMEX Gold Futures: 4.63
- Chow Tai Fook: 6.08
- Chow Sang Sang: 10.07 (highest)
- Luk Fook Holdings: 6.26
- Hang Seng Index: 4.71

**Interpretation:** Kurtosis values >> 3 indicate "fat tails" - extreme price movements occur more frequently than normal distribution predicts. This has critical implications for risk modeling, VaR calculations, and portfolio construction. Traditional mean-variance optimization may underestimate tail risk.

**Monthly/Quarterly Returns:**
- Monthly: Continue to reject normality (p < 0.05) for most assets
- Quarterly: Mixed results - some assets fail to reject normality, suggesting Central Limit Theorem effects as returns aggregate over longer periods smooth out extreme daily movements

**Central Limit Theorem Manifestation:**
While daily returns strongly deviate from normality, quarterly/yearly aggregations approach normality for several assets. This occurs because quarterly returns represent sums of approximately 60-65 daily returns. Despite daily returns not being strictly independent or identically distributed, the CLT effect reduces skewness and kurtosis, making distributions closer to normal. This has important modeling implications - quarterly/yearly data may be more suitable for traditional parametric statistical methods.

## 3. Correlation Analysis Across Time Frequencies

### 3.1 Daily Correlations

**Gold Assets Intercorrelations:**
- COMEX-GLD: 0.998
- COMEX-IAU: 0.997
- GLD-IAU: 0.999

*Implication:* Near-perfect correlation confirms these are essentially interchangeable gold price proxies. Using all three would create severe multicollinearity in regression models (VIF >> 10).

**Gold Assets to Jewelry Stocks:**
- COMEX to Gold Jewelry Index: ~0.05 (very weak)
- COMEX to Chow Tai Fook: ~0.08
- COMEX to Luk Fook: ~0.06
- COMEX to Chow Sang Sang: ~0.05

*Interpretation:* Daily gold price movements have minimal immediate impact on jewelry stock returns. Short-term noise dominates: company-specific news, intraday trading dynamics, general market sentiment overwhelm the fundamental gold price relationship.

**Jewelry Stocks to Hang Seng Index:**
- Chow Tai Fook to HSI: 0.42
- Luk Fook to HSI: 0.48
- Chow Sang Sang to HSI: 0.47
- Gold Jewelry Index to HSI: 0.52

*Interpretation:* Moderate-to-strong correlation demonstrates these stocks are significantly driven by broader Hong Kong market movements independent of gold prices.

### 3.2 Monthly Correlations

**Gold to Jewelry Stocks (Progressive Strengthening):**
- COMEX to Gold Jewelry Index: 0.34 (moderate, 7× increase from daily)
- COMEX to Chow Tai Fook: 0.36
- COMEX to Luk Fook: 0.30
- COMEX to Chow Sang Sang: 0.32

*Interpretation:* Sustained monthly gold price movements begin showing clear relationship with jewelry stocks. Market has time to process implications of persistent gold price trends for company costs, revenues, and margins.

**Jewelry to Hang Seng Index:**
- Chow Tai Fook to HSI: 0.44
- Luk Fook to HSI: 0.51
- Chow Sang Sang to HSI: 0.47
- Gold Jewelry Index to HSI: 0.50

*Interpretation:* Hong Kong market influence remains strong and consistent.

**Gold to Hang Seng Index:**
- COMEX to HSI: 0.25

*Interpretation:* Gold prices show weak-moderate correlation with broader market, suggesting some shared macroeconomic drivers (inflation expectations, currency movements, risk sentiment) but largely independent dynamics.

### 3.3 Quarterly Correlations

**Gold to Jewelry Stocks (Continued Strengthening):**
- COMEX to Gold Jewelry Index: 0.36 (moderate-strong)
- Individual stocks: 0.28-0.41 range

*Interpretation:* Quarterly financial reporting cycle aligns with this frequency. Quarterly results reflect gold price impact on COGS, gross margins, and inventory valuations. Market expectations adjust to fundamental implications.

**Jewelry to Hang Seng Index:**
- Gold Jewelry Index to HSI: 0.46
- Individual stocks: 0.42-0.47 range

**Gold to Hang Seng Index:**
- COMEX to HSI: 0.35

*Interpretation:* Longer-term shared macroeconomic influences become more apparent.

### 3.4 Yearly Correlations

**Gold to Jewelry Stocks (Strongest Relationship):**
- COMEX to Gold Jewelry Index: 0.54 (strong, 11× increase from daily)
- Individual stocks: 0.45-0.59 range

*Interpretation:* Annual financial results comprehensively reflect gold price environment. Revenue (for fixed-price items), COGS, inventory gains/losses, pricing strategies, and long-term consumer demand all align with yearly gold price trends. Fundamental relationship fully manifests.

**Jewelry to Hang Seng Index:**
- Gold Jewelry Index to HSI: 0.43
- Remains consistently moderate-strong

**Gold to Hang Seng Index:**
- COMEX to HSI: 0.53

*Interpretation:* Long-term shared macroeconomic drivers (economic growth, inflation, currency trends) create stronger correlation between gold and broad market over yearly horizons.

### 3.5 Cross-Frequency Summary

The progressive strengthening pattern validates the hypothesis that gold-jewelry relationships are fundamentally time-dependent:

| Frequency | Gold-Jewelry ρ | Percentage Increase from Daily |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Daily     | 0.05          | Baseline                      |
| Monthly   | 0.34          | +580%                         |
| Quarterly | 0.36          | +620%                         |
| Yearly    | 0.54          | +980%                         |

## 4. Simple Linear Regression Analysis

### 4.1 Model Specification

**Model:** Gold_Jewelry_Index_Returns = β₀ + β₁(COMEX_Gold_Futures_Returns) + ε

### 4.2 Results by Frequency

**Daily Regression:**
- R² = 0.003
- Adjusted R² = 0.003
- β₁ (Gold Coefficient) = 0.049
- P-value (β₁) = 0.0028 (statistically significant at α = 0.01)
- Interpretation: While statistically significant due to large sample size (n ≈ 3,500), gold futures explain only 0.3% of daily jewelry index variance. Economic significance is minimal.

**Monthly Regression:**
- R² = 0.115
- Adjusted R² = 0.109
- β₁ (Gold Coefficient) = 0.348
- P-value (β₁) < 0.0001 (highly significant)
- Interpretation: Gold futures explain 11.5% of monthly jewelry index variance. A 1% increase in monthly gold futures returns associates with 0.35% increase in jewelry index returns. Economically meaningful relationship emerges.

**Quarterly Regression:**
- R² = 0.131
- Adjusted R² = 0.115
- β₁ (Gold Coefficient) = 0.377
- P-value (β₁) < 0.0001 (highly significant)
- Interpretation: Gold futures explain 13.1% of quarterly variance. Relationship strengthens further; quarterly financial reporting alignment makes connection more apparent.

**Yearly Regression:**
- R² = 0.290
- Adjusted R² = 0.231
- β₁ (Gold Coefficient) = 0.538
- P-value (β₁) = 0.0091 (significant at α = 0.01)
- Interpretation: Gold futures explain 29% of yearly variance - strong fundamental relationship. A 1% yearly gold price increase associates with 0.54% jewelry index increase. Note: Yearly analysis has limited observations (n ≈ 12-14), reducing statistical power but still achieving significance.

### 4.3 Progressive R² Pattern

The dramatic R² increase from daily (0.003) to yearly (0.290) represents a 97-fold improvement in explanatory power, confirming that time horizon fundamentally determines the strength of the gold-jewelry relationship.

## 5. Multiple Regression Analysis: Controlling for Market Effects

### 5.1 Model Specification

**Model:** Gold_Jewelry_Index_Returns = β₀ + β₁(COMEX_Returns) + β₂(Hang_Seng_Returns) + ε

### 5.2 Results and Comparison to Simple Regression

**Daily Multiple Regression:**
- R² = 0.291 (vs 0.003 simple) - massive improvement
- Adjusted R² = 0.290
- β₁ (Gold Coef) = 0.031, P-value = 0.051 (marginal significance)
- β₂ (HSI Coef) = 0.626, P-value < 0.0001 (highly significant)
- Interpretation: Hang Seng Index dominates daily movements, explaining 29.1% of variance. Gold effect becomes marginal when controlling for market. Short-term jewelry stock performance primarily driven by broad market dynamics.

**Monthly Multiple Regression:**
- R² = 0.393 (vs 0.115 simple)
- Adjusted R² = 0.385
- β₁ (Gold Coef) = 0.235, P-value = 0.0003 (highly significant)
- β₂ (HSI Coef) = 0.531, P-value < 0.0001 (highly significant)
- Interpretation: Both predictors significant. HSI explains much variance, but gold retains independent predictive power. After controlling for market, gold still explains additional variance. Combined model explains 39.3% of monthly variance.

**Quarterly Multiple Regression:**
- R² = 0.465 (vs 0.131 simple)
- Adjusted R² = 0.455
- β₁ (Gold Coef) = 0.267, P-value = 0.0012 (highly significant)
- β₂ (HSI Coef) = 0.538, P-value < 0.0001 (highly significant)
- Interpretation: Gold coefficient remains substantial and significant. Combined model explains 46.5% of quarterly variance - strongest model performance. Both gold and market effects independently important.

**Yearly Multiple Regression:**
- R² = 0.542 (vs 0.290 simple)
- Adjusted R² = 0.527
- β₁ (Gold Coef) = 0.349, P-value = 0.0234 (significant at α = 0.05)
- β₂ (HSI Coef) = 0.461, P-value = 0.0089 (significant at α = 0.01)
- Interpretation: Over yearly horizons, both gold and market movements significantly impact jewelry stocks. Combined model explains 54.2% of yearly variance. Gold effect persists even when controlling for market.

### 5.3 Critical Finding: Gold Price Independent Effect

**Key Observation:** When Hang Seng Index is added to the model, gold coefficient magnitude decreases across all frequencies (e.g., monthly: 0.348 → 0.235), indicating some shared variance between gold prices and broad market. However, gold coefficient remains statistically significant at monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies (p < 0.05).

**Implication:** Gold price movements have independent predictive power for jewelry stock returns beyond their correlation with broader market movements. This validates the fundamental economic channel: gold price changes affect jewelry companies through both cost structures and demand dynamics, not merely as a proxy for general market sentiment.

### 5.4 Hang Seng Index Dominance

Across all frequencies, Hang Seng Index coefficients are consistently larger than gold coefficients and highly significant (p < 0.0001). This reflects:
1. These are Hong Kong-listed equities subject to regional market dynamics
2. General market sentiment, liquidity conditions, and macroeconomic factors in Hong Kong significantly drive stock performance
3. Jewelry stocks have substantial systematic risk (market beta) beyond commodity exposure

## 6. Non-Linear Regression Analysis: F-Test Results

### 6.1 Model Specification

**Model:** Gold_Jewelry_Index_Returns = β₀ + β₁(COMEX) + β₂(HSI) + β₃(COMEX²) + β₄(HSI²) + β₅(COMEX × HSI) + ε

Testing for:
- Quadratic effects (β₃, β₄): Do squared terms capture accelerating/decelerating relationships?
- Interaction effects (β₅): Does gold's impact vary with market conditions?

### 6.2 Formal F-Test Methodology

For nested regression models, the F-test compares the restricted model (linear) against the unrestricted model (non-linear) using the test statistic:

\[F = \frac{(SSR_{Linear} - SSR_{NonLinear}) / p}{SSR_{NonLinear} / (n - k - 1)}\]

Where:
- SSR = Sum of Squared Residuals
- p = number of non-linear parameters added (3 in this analysis)
- n = number of observations
- k = number of parameters in linear model (2 in this analysis)

**Decision Rule:**
- H₀: Non-linear parameters = 0 (linear model sufficient)
- H₁: At least one non-linear parameter ≠ 0 (non-linear model needed)
- Reject H₀ if p-value < 0.05

### 6.3 Daily Non-Linear Results

**Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.2661
- Adj R² = 0.2657
- N = 3,308

**Non-Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.2700
- Adj R² = 0.2688
- Condition Number: 6.15e+03 (indicates potential multicollinearity)

**F-Test Results:**
- F-Statistic = 5.8054
- P-value = 0.0006
- ΔR² = 0.0039 (modest 0.39% improvement)

**Individual Non-Linear Term Significance:**
- COMEX² (HSI_sq): p = 0.000 (highly significant)
- HSI² (HSI_sq): p = 0.000 (highly significant)
- Interaction: p = 0.274 (not significant)

**Interpretation:** Despite the modest R² improvement, the F-test indicates the non-linear model is **statistically significantly better** than the linear model (p = 0.0006). The HSI² term is particularly important (p = 0.000), suggesting the market effect exhibits non-linear (accelerating/decelerating) dynamics at daily frequency. However, the practical economic significance is limited - the 0.39% R² improvement means the non-linear terms explain only an additional 0.39 percentage points of variance. The high condition number suggests multicollinearity is a concern in the non-linear specification.

### 6.4 Monthly Non-Linear Results

**Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.3006
- Adj R² = 0.2920
- N = 166

**Non-Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.3390
- Adj R² = 0.3183
- Condition Number: 598

**F-Test Results:**
- F-Statistic = 3.0950
- P-value = 0.0286
- ΔR² = 0.0384 (3.84% improvement)

**Individual Non-Linear Term Significance:**
- COMEX²: p = 0.537 (not significant)
- HSI²: p = 0.006 (significant)
- Interaction: p = 0.393 (not significant)

**Interpretation:** The F-test indicates the non-linear model is **statistically significantly better** (p = 0.0286). The HSI² term is significant at monthly frequency, suggesting the market effect is non-linear. However, note that Adjusted R² increased from 0.2920 to 0.3183, indicating genuine improvement after penalizing for added complexity. With only 166 observations and 6 parameters in the non-linear model, the result should be interpreted cautiously. The COMEX coefficient (β₁ = 0.5012) and HSI coefficient (β₂ = 0.7970) in the linear model remain highly significant (p < 0.001).

### 6.5 Quarterly Non-Linear Results

**Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.2526
- Adj R² = 0.2244
- N = 56

**Non-Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.2862
- Adj R² = 0.2148
- Condition Number: 270

**F-Test Results:**
- F-Statistic = 0.7850
- P-value = 0.5080
- ΔR² = 0.0336 (3.36% improvement in R²)

**Individual Non-Linear Term Significance:**
- COMEX²: p = 0.619 (not significant)
- HSI²: p = 0.164 (not significant)
- Interaction: p = 0.194 (not significant)

**Interpretation:** The F-test indicates the non-linear model is **NOT statistically significantly better** than linear (p = 0.5080 >> 0.05). Despite the raw R² increasing by 3.36%, none of the non-linear terms are individually significant, and crucially, the Adjusted R² **decreased** from 0.2244 to 0.2148. This demonstrates that the R² improvement came from fitting noise rather than capturing true non-linear relationships. With only 56 quarterly observations, adding 3 parameters substantially penalizes model fit. **Conclusion: Linear model is preferred for quarterly analysis.**

### 6.6 Yearly Non-Linear Results

**Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.3205
- Adj R² = 0.1969
- N = 14

**Non-Linear Model:**
- R² = 0.5563
- Adj R² = 0.2790
- Condition Number: 86.0

**F-Test Results:**
- F-Statistic = 1.4171
- P-value = 0.3074
- ΔR² = 0.2358 (23.58% improvement in R²)

**Individual Non-Linear Term Significance:**
- COMEX²: p = 0.387 (not significant)
- HSI²: p = 0.302 (not significant)
- Interaction: p = 0.963 (not significant)

**Interpretation:** Despite the large raw R² improvement (23.58%), the F-test indicates the non-linear model is **NOT statistically significantly better** (p = 0.3074 >> 0.05). None of the non-linear terms are significant. Critically, the Adjusted R² increased from 0.1969 to 0.2790, but this improvement is modest given the penalty for adding 3 parameters with n = 14 observations. The yearly analysis is severely constrained by sample size (only 14 observations), making it inappropriate to add 3 non-linear parameters. The apparent large R² gain is likely due to overfitting. **Conclusion: Linear model is strongly preferred for yearly analysis.**

### 6.7 Comprehensive F-Test Summary

| Frequency | F-Stat | P-value | Result | ΔR² | Adj R² Change | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|-----|---------------|----------------|
| Daily | 5.81 | 0.0006 | Reject H₀ | +0.39% | ✓ improved to 0.2688 | Non-linear better, but marginal gain |
| Monthly | 3.10 | 0.0286 | Reject H₀ | +3.84% | ✓ improved to 0.3183 | Non-linear statistically better |
| Quarterly | 0.79 | 0.5080 | Fail to reject H₀ | +3.36% | ✗ decreased to 0.2148 | Linear sufficient |
| Yearly | 1.42 | 0.3074 | Fail to reject H₀ | +23.58% | ✓ improved to 0.2790 | Severe overfitting, linear preferred |

**Overall Conclusion:** F-tests reveal mixed evidence for non-linearity:

1. **Daily & Monthly:** Non-linear models are statistically significantly better (p < 0.05), with HSI² terms significant (p < 0.01 daily, p = 0.006 monthly). This suggests the Hang Seng Index's impact on jewelry stocks exhibits some accelerating/decelerating effects at shorter time horizons.

2. **Quarterly & Yearly:** Linear models are statistically preferred. Despite raw R² improvements in non-linear specifications, formal F-tests reject the added complexity. This is particularly pronounced at yearly frequency where extreme sample size limitation (n = 14) makes non-linear parameter estimation unreliable.

3. **Practical Significance:** Even where non-linear models achieve statistical significance (daily: p = 0.0006, monthly: p = 0.0286), the economic significance is limited. The non-linear terms add minimal predictive power (daily: 0.39% R² improvement, monthly: 3.84% R² improvement).

4. **Multicollinearity Concerns:** The condition numbers increase substantially in non-linear models (particularly daily: 6.15e+03), indicating potential multicollinearity issues from squared terms and interaction effects.

**Recommendation:** For daily and monthly analyses, non-linear specifications can be retained if stakeholders value the statistically significant (though economically modest) improvements. For quarterly and especially yearly horizons, linear models should be used to avoid overfitting and maintain interpretability with limited observations.

## 7. Time Frequency Impact: Economic Interpretation

### 7.1 Daily Dynamics: Noise Dominates

**Why Weak Daily Relationship (R² = 0.003)?**

Multiple factors create daily noise:
1. **Intraday Trading Dynamics:** Momentum trading, technical signals, liquidity shocks unrelated to fundamentals
2. **Market Microstructure:** Bid-ask bounces, price discovery processes, order flow imbalances
3. **Information Asymmetry:** Company-specific news (management changes, store openings, competitive actions) affects individual stocks immediately
4. **Sentiment Volatility:** Short-term risk appetite fluctuations drive general equity volatility
5. **Gold Price Insignificance:** Minor daily gold fluctuations (±0.5-1%) don't immediately alter profitability expectations or warrant repricing

Gold price is one of many inputs, and daily changes are too small/transient to shift investment thesis. The presence of significant daily non-linearity (HSI² effect) suggests market microstructure and sentiment changes create non-linear dynamics not captured by linear models.

### 7.2 Monthly/Quarterly Dynamics: Fundamentals Emerge

**Why Strengthening Relationship (R² = 0.115-0.131)?**

1. **Sustained Price Trends:** Persistent monthly movements (e.g., +5-10% over month) represent meaningful cost/revenue changes
2. **Financial Reporting Alignment:** Quarterly earnings reports capture gold price impact on:
   - Cost of Goods Sold (direct material costs)
   - Gross Margin trends
   - Inventory valuation (FIFO/weighted average accounting)
3. **Pricing Strategy Adjustments:** Companies have time to adjust retail prices for fixed-price items
4. **Consumer Behavior Response:** Sustained price increases trigger:
   - Accelerated purchasing before further increases (demand surge)
   - Investment buying (gold as store of value)
   - Brand switching based on relative pricing
5. **Analyst Coverage:** Monthly/quarterly updates from sell-side analysts incorporate gold price forecasts into earnings models, influencing institutional investor positioning

Market participants gain sufficient time horizon to assess and price fundamental impacts. The monthly F-test result (p = 0.0286) suggests non-linear market effects still influence returns at this frequency, though less dominantly than at daily.

### 7.3 Yearly Dynamics: Fundamental Relationship Dominates

**Why Strongest Relationship (R² = 0.290)?**

1. **Annual Financial Statements:** Comprehensive reflection of gold price environment:
   - Full-year revenue heavily influenced by average gold price level (fixed-price sales)
   - Full-year COGS directly tied to gold procurement costs
   - Inventory gains/losses fully realized
   - Year-end valuation adjustments
2. **Strategic Adjustments Complete:** Companies implement:
   - Pricing strategy changes
   - Product mix optimization
   - Hedging program adjustments
   - Inventory management refinements
3. **Long-Term Investor Positioning:** Institutional investors with yearly rebalancing cycles incorporate gold price outlook into valuations
4. **Business Cycle Alignment:** Annual performance captures:
   - Seasonal variations (Chinese New Year, wedding seasons) fully integrated
   - Consumer spending patterns influenced by persistent gold price trends
   - Competitive dynamics and market share shifts
5. **Macroeconomic Integration:** Yearly gold price trends reflect and correlate with broader economic conditions (inflation, currency movements, growth expectations) that also fundamentally affect consumer discretionary spending and luxury goods demand

The yearly view captures the complete economic transmission mechanism from commodity prices → company fundamentals → stock valuations. Notably, the F-test for yearly non-linear specification (p = 0.3074) indicates that this frequency's relationships are sufficiently captured by linear models, suggesting fundamental factors dominate over complex non-linear market microstructure effects.

## 8. Understanding the Positive Correlation: Economic Mechanisms

### 8.1 The Counterintuitive Result

Traditional cost-based reasoning suggests: Rising gold prices → Higher raw material costs → Lower profit margins → Negative stock performance

However, empirical results show: Rising gold prices → **Positive** jewelry stock returns

This requires explanation through demand-side mechanisms specific to Chinese gold jewelry market.

### 8.2 Investment Demand and Price Expectations

**Cultural Context:** In Chinese culture, gold jewelry serves dual purposes:
1. Adornment and cultural significance (weddings, festivals)
2. Investment vehicle and wealth preservation

**Demand Channel:**
- Rising gold prices create positive feedback loop
- Consumers anticipate further increases
- "Buy now before prices rise more" mentality
- Gold jewelry as tangible inflation hedge
- Preference for physical assets over financial assets in certain demographics

**Evidence:** This behavior particularly strong in:
- Tier 2-3 Chinese cities with less developed financial markets
- Older demographics with traditional investment preferences
- Periods of currency depreciation or inflation concerns

### 8.3 Inventory Valuation Effects

**Mechanism:**
- Companies maintain significant gold inventory (both raw materials and finished goods)
- Rising gold prices increase balance sheet asset values
- FIFO or weighted-average accounting methods reflect gains
- Inventory gains boost reported profitability in rising price environments
- Enhanced balance sheet quality improves credit ratings and borrowing costs

**Magnitude:** Large retailers may hold several tons of gold inventory. A 10% gold price increase on 5,000 kg inventory at $60,000/kg = $30 million inventory gain.

### 8.4 Price Pass-Through Capability

**Fixed-Price Business Model:**
- Major Chinese jewelry chains prominently feature "fixed-price" gold items
- Selling price formula: (Current Gold Price per Gram × Item Weight) + Labor/Design Fee + Retail Markup
- Prices adjust automatically/daily based on current gold market rates
- Consumers accept pricing mechanism (transparently displayed in stores)

**Margin Protection:**
- Companies can immediately pass increased costs to consumers
- Labor/design fees and retail markups often calculated as percentages, amplifying in absolute terms when base gold price rises
- Gross margins on fixed-price items remain stable or improve
- Premium brand positioning allows for additional markup expansion during gold price rallies

### 8.5 Brand Value Enhancement

**Premium Positioning:**
- Rising gold prices enhance perceived value of jewelry
- "My necklace is worth more now" psychology
- Brand prestige associated with higher-value inventory
- Justifies and reinforces premium pricing on non-fixed-price (high craftsmanship) items
- Marketing benefits: "Investment-grade jewelry" positioning

### 8.6 Company Growth Trajectories

**Confounding Factor:**
All analyzed companies experienced substantial growth 2010-2025:
- Geographic expansion (new store openings in emerging markets)
- E-commerce channel development
- Brand maturation and market penetration increases
- Rising middle-class consumption in China
- Improved operational efficiency and supply chain management

**Implication:** Positive stock returns over the period partly reflect inherent company growth independent of gold prices. Gold price correlation may capture some of this if growth periods coincided with gold rallies, or if company expansions were strategically timed to gold market conditions.

### 8.7 Integrated Explanation

The **positive correlation** results from demand-side effects (investment demand, price expectations, cultural preferences) overwhelming supply-side cost increases, particularly in the Chinese market context where gold jewelry combines consumption and investment functions. This is amplified by companies' pricing power, inventory management capabilities, and inherent growth trends.

Over longer time horizons (yearly), these fundamental dynamics fully materialize in financial statements and market valuations, explaining the strengthening positive relationship. The relative absence of non-linear effects at yearly frequency suggests these demand and cost dynamics follow predictable, linear relationships.

## 9. Key Findings and Conclusions

### 9.1 Primary Findings

1. **Time-Dependent Relationship Strength:** The relationship between gold futures returns and Chinese gold jewelry stock returns is fundamentally time-dependent, with correlation and R² values increasing dramatically from daily to yearly horizons. This pattern is statistically robust and economically interpretable.

2. **Independent Gold Price Effect:** Gold futures returns maintain statistically significant predictive power for jewelry stock returns (p < 0.05) even after controlling for Hang Seng Index movements at monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies. This validates the fundamental economic linkage beyond simple market correlation.

3. **Market Dominance at Short Horizons:** The Hang Seng Index is the dominant driver of daily and monthly jewelry stock returns (larger coefficients, stronger significance), reflecting the substantial systematic risk (market beta) inherent in these equities.

4. **Fundamental Relationship at Long Horizons:** Over quarterly and especially yearly periods, gold prices become substantially more important (R² increases from 0.003 to 0.290 simple regression; 0.291 to 0.542 multiple regression), capturing their fundamental impact on business economics, financial performance, and investor valuations.

5. **Non-Linear Effects Limited to Short Frequencies:** F-tests reveal statistically significant non-linear improvements for daily (F = 5.81, p = 0.0006) and monthly (F = 3.10, p = 0.0286) frequencies, driven primarily by significant HSI² terms (p < 0.01 daily, p = 0.006 monthly). However, these improvements are economically modest (daily: +0.39% R², monthly: +3.84% R²). For quarterly and yearly frequencies, linear models are statistically preferred; non-linear specifications suffer from overfitting concerns particularly at yearly frequency with only 14 observations.

6. **Positive Correlation Mechanism:** The consistently positive correlation between gold prices and jewelry stock returns, while counterintuitive from a pure cost perspective, is explained by demand-side factors (investment demand, price expectations, inventory gains, pricing pass-through) that dominate cost pressures in the Chinese market context.

### 9.2 Statistical Robustness

- All key relationships achieve statistical significance at conventional levels (p < 0.05)
- Results consistent across multiple model specifications (simple, multiple, non-linear with F-test validation)
- Pattern replicates across individual stocks and composite index
- Findings align with economic theory and industry knowledge
- F-test methodology formally validates model comparisons

### 9.3 Economic Significance

While statistical significance is achieved, economic significance varies:
- Daily models have weak economic significance (R² = 0.003 simple, β ≈ 0.05) despite non-linear improvements
- Monthly/quarterly models show moderate economic significance (R² = 0.12-0.13 simple, β ≈ 0.35-0.38)
- Yearly models demonstrate strong economic significance (R² = 0.29 simple, 0.54 multiple)

For practical investment applications, monthly and longer horizons provide actionable relationships.

## 11. Practical Implications

### 11.1 For Investors

**Investment Strategy Considerations:**
- **Time Horizon Alignment:** Short-term traders should focus on Hang Seng Index movements; long-term investors should incorporate gold price forecasts
- **Diversification Benefits:** Chinese gold jewelry stocks provide blended exposure to both commodity prices and Hong Kong equities
- **Tactical Allocation:** Gold price trends may offer signals for 3-12 month positioning in jewelry stocks
- **Risk Management:** Higher volatility than gold or broad market requires appropriate position sizing; stop-loss disciplines important
- **Non-Linear Market Effects:** Daily and monthly traders should be aware that market sentiment creates non-linear effects not fully captured by linear models; traditional risk metrics may underestimate extreme moves

**Portfolio Construction:**
- Jewelry stocks offer differentiated risk-return profile vs. pure gold exposure (mining stocks, ETFs) or pure equity exposure
- Positive correlation with gold provides partial inflation hedge within equity portfolio
- Consider jewelry stocks as satellite holding (5-15% allocation) in Asia-Pacific equity sleeves
- The time-frequency-dependent relationship suggests portfolio rebalancing should consider holding period: daily hedges may need non-linear adjustments, while long-term positions can use simpler linear models

### 11.2 For Company Management

**Strategic Planning:**
- **Pricing Strategy:** Dynamic pricing for fixed-price items should closely track gold spot prices with minimal lag
- **Inventory Management:** Optimize inventory levels considering gold price forecasts; strategic inventory build during anticipated rallies
- **Product Mix:** Balance fixed-price (gold-price-sensitive) vs. high-craftsmanship (design-premium) offerings based on gold market outlook
- **Hedging Decisions:** Cost-benefit analysis of futures/options hedging considering positive demand elasticity to gold prices
- **Investor Relations:** Clearly communicate gold price transmission mechanisms to equity analysts and investors; explain positive correlation thesis to address investor skepticism

**Operational Implications:**
- Procurement timing: Centralized gold purchasing with market timing capabilities
- Working capital management: Rising gold prices increase working capital needs
- Expansion timing: Consider gold price environment when planning store network growth
- Non-linear Market Effects: Daily operational decisions may need to account for non-linear market sentiment dynamics

### 11.3 For Policymakers

**Market Stability Monitoring:**
- Gold price volatility has amplified effects on jewelry retail sector through both cost and demand channels
- Sudden gold price spikes may create consumer panic buying and inventory speculation
- Non-linear daily effects suggest market volatility can create amplified impacts

**Consumer Protection:**
- Ensure pricing transparency for fixed-price gold jewelry
- Regulate misleading "investment value" marketing claims
- Monitor retailer markup practices during gold price volatility

**Economic Indicators:**
- Jewelry sales volumes may serve as indicators of:
  - Consumer discretionary spending and confidence
  - Inflation expectations (gold as inflation hedge)
  - Wealth effect from gold price changes
- Time-frequency dependency suggests that quarterly/yearly jewelry sales may be better economic indicators than daily/weekly metrics

## 12. Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis provides robust empirical evidence of a positive, statistically significant, and time-frequency-dependent relationship between gold futures prices and Chinese gold jewelry company stock returns. The relationship strengthens dramatically from negligible daily correlation (ρ = 0.05, R² = 0.003) to strong yearly correlation (ρ = 0.54, R² = 0.290), reflecting the time required for fundamental economic transmission mechanisms to manifest in corporate financial performance and investor valuations.

Critically, gold price movements retain independent predictive power for jewelry stock returns even after controlling for broader Hong Kong market movements (Hang Seng Index), particularly at monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies. This validates the fundamental economic channel: gold price changes affect these companies through both raw material cost structures and consumer demand dynamics, with the latter appearing to dominate in the Chinese market context due to gold's dual role as consumption good and investment asset.

Formal F-tests comparing linear and non-linear model specifications reveal that polynomial relationships with squared terms and interaction effects provide statistically significant improvements for daily (F = 5.81, p = 0.0006) and monthly (F = 3.10, p = 0.0286) frequencies, primarily driven by significant Hang Seng Index squared terms capturing non-linear market microstructure effects. However, these non-linear improvements are economically modest (0.39-3.84% R² gains). For quarterly and yearly frequencies, linear models are statistically preferred and theoretically justified, avoiding overfitting concerns particularly acute at yearly frequency with limited observations (n = 14).

The analysis reveals that linear models adequately capture fundamental relationships within the tested framework; non-linear specifications capture additional short-term market noise without meaningful predictive improvement. The consistently positive correlation, while initially counterintuitive from a pure cost perspective, is economically rationalized by demand-side factors (investment demand driven by price expectations, inventory valuation effects, pricing pass-through capabilities, and cultural preferences for gold as wealth storage) that overwhelm raw material cost pressures.

These findings have important implications for investors (time-horizon-appropriate strategies, diversification benefits, consideration of non-linear effects at short horizons), corporate managers (pricing strategy, inventory optimization, hedging decisions, awareness of market microstructure effects), and policymakers (market stability monitoring, consumer protection, economic indicator development).

This research establishes a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between commodity prices, consumer behavior, market microstructure, and stock market valuations in the Chinese gold jewelry sector, highlighting the critical importance of time frequency selection in financial analysis and the unique market dynamics created by gold's multifaceted role in Chinese consumer culture. The formal F-test validation of model specifications provides methodological rigor to support practical decision-making.
