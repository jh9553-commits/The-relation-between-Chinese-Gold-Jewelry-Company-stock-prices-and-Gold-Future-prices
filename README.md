This research examines the relationship between Chinese gold jewelry company stock prices and gold futures prices using data from 2010-2025 across multiple time frequencies. A market-cap-weighted Gold Jewelry Index was constructed from three major Hong Kong-listed companies. Analysis reveals a consistently positive and statistically significant relationship that strengthens dramatically across time horizons: daily (R² = 0.003, β = 0.05), monthly (R² = 0.115, β = 0.35), quarterly (R² = 0.131, β = 0.38), and yearly (R² = 0.290, β = 0.54). After controlling for broader market movements via the Hang Seng Index in multiple regression models, gold price movements retain independent predictive power (p < 0.05) for jewelry stock returns at monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies, validating the fundamental economic linkage between raw material costs/demand dynamics and corporate valuations. Formal F-tests comparing linear and non-linear models reveal that polynomial specifications with squared terms and interaction effects provide statistically significant improvements only for daily and monthly frequencies, while simpler linear specifications are optimal at quarterly and yearly horizons.
